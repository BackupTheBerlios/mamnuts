MAMNUTS CHANEGLOG:

Following the directions that can be read at
http://mindboosternoori.blogspot.com/2005/11/building-talker.html , the idea os
MAMNUTS is to provide a secure an stable code base until AmNUTS 2.3.0 isn't
done. Here's the roadmap:

v1.0:
Release MAMNUTS as AmNUTS CVS is right now, but with the changes to show that
this is MAMNUTS and not AmNUTS.
This won't be a bug-free version, but will be the most bugless talker base
there is...

v1.1:
Fix #3: The easy fix is to take out the .sreboot command.

v1.2:
Fix #11: The easy fix is to take out the .kill command.

v1.3:
Fix #23: The easy fix is to take out .xcom and .gcom commands.
Fixed the wrapper bug ( http://mamnuts.blogspot.com/2005/12/bug.html )

v1.4:
Fix #46: http://amnuts.dune.net/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=46

v1.5:
Spodlist was utterly broken for some compilers, so it was removed.
Description length is now variable with the maximum name length.
Grep user was somewhat broken in the presentation layer, so it was removed.
The clear screen function now does the right thing and sends the clear screen
escape character. Since not every "telnet client" supports it (shame on them!)
the character is still preceeded by a flood of new lines (more, this time), so
nobody looses .cls functionality.

v1.6:
Now there are helpfiles in English or Portuguese. The default is English, but
you just have to change the config file to point out to the Portuguese support.
Thanks to NomadWolf for helping with the translation. If you know any other
language and want to contribute with translations, we'll gladly accept your
help and include them!
user->recap now resets the terminal colours. That will make an usefull use of
user->recap and user->bw_recap in a way that you'll never need to escape
colours to do whatever you want.
.read shows user->recap instead of user->bw_recap .

v1.7:
Fixed a bug on user descriptions.

v1.8:
Purged MANDNS code from Mamnuts. This code, despite having better performance
in BSD systems, isn't that well written (as we can see with the use of
isspace()), and uses popen, which is a blocking call. This also improoves the
talker performance in Solaris systems.

v1.8.1:
Fixed a big load of bugs. Some where killed by removing some funcionalities,
being the biggest, probably, personal rooms. If you want to contribute with a
well-written bugless patch to implement dynamic rooms, please, PLEASE contact
me. Otherwise, we won't have them for a looong time... Check ROADMAP to see
what I'm talking about here.
New .visual command added, but commented on the code, since it still has some
bugs. Uncomment and use it on your own risk... I intend to fix that code and
have it on mamnuts ASAP. The biggest problem with that code is that it won't
even compile in some systems. If you're using Linux, you'll probably have to
worries, but I can't promiss anything.

v1.8.2:
Even if mamnuts isn't about "creating new commands", there are commands that
are really nice to have. Thus, this version adds .sto.

v1.8.3:
SECURITY FIX: avoided a buffer overflow on .wizlist by removing it. Take in
consideration that this bug puts your talker (and talker account) security in
risk, and is present in ANY VERSION of Amnuts and Mamnuts!!! More information
about this bug will be given by request.
