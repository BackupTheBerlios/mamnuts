MAMNUTS ROADMAP
===============

--- Concept:

Following the directions that can be read at
http://mindboosternoori.blogspot.com/2005/11/building-talker.html , the idea os
MAMNUTS is to provide a secure an stable code base until AmNUTS 2.3.0 is done.


--- Towards full security and stability:

v1.8.5:
Implement a SpamGuard system. Better yet, if time lets me do it, implement
something like Uzume suggests in
http://amnuts.talker.com/cgi-bin/AMboard/UltraBoard.pl?Action=ShowPost&Board=bugs&Post=73&Idle=0&Sort=0&Order=Descend&Page=0&Session=

v1.8.6:
Warnings cleanup (important for compatibility issues).

v1.8.7:
Remove smail related code: .smail .rmail and such commands AND everything that
sends or uses it's code.

v1.9.0:
Fix #36: Revert "multi-line paste" changes. It will reduce usability but fix a
security issue. 

v2.0.0:
Fix the charset issues with non-ASCII chr()'s. This mean implementing a proper
telnet support, or, at least, filter those characters and bind them to static
printouts.
This will be (hopefully) a bug-free talker base.


--- Improoving functionality:

v2.0.1:
Uncomment and finish tmore's implementation...

v2.1.0:
The 'AFK' function (including command, calls, presentation et all) should be
renamed 'BUSY'.

v2.2.0: 
Implementation of an SSLPORT, similar to WIZPORT but that provides the
possibility of telnet-ssl connections.

v2.3.0: 
Modularize all ports, to MAINPORT (to be renamed to TELPORT), WIZPORT (renamed
to TWIZPORT) and SSLPORT can be included or not. That will give more
configurability (for instance, set up a talker that only allows telnet-ssl
connections).

v2.4.0: 
Major clean-up of the code and documentation effort.

v2.5.0: 
Re-implement a messaging system to replace the 'smail' functions. Implement it
to mails, news, suggestions and virtualy everything that uses the actual EDITOR
calls.

v2.6.0:
Implement dynamic rooms.
